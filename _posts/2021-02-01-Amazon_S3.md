S3 is the storage feature of Amazon Web Services. Things are stored within **buckets** and the storage contents are called **objects**. There is encryption for buckets. 
# Lifecycle Rules
The system allows a user to determine when objects transfer between s3 tiers in time amounts or when the past versions will be deleted. 
# Versioning
Once versioning is turned off for a bucket; it can't be disabled. Each version has to be individually selected before it can be deleted or made a public. 
# Prefixes
How many prefixes within your bucket object name determine how many requests can be made to it. 

I think S3 is a much more robust system than classic file storage like Windows uses. There are some many precautions put into place to prevent accidental data loss and or reduce costs that are spent to store the data using the multiple tiers. 
Intelligent tiering is really awesome. The term just means that objects are switched by AWS for you when needed.
