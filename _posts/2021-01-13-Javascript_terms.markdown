# Terms
<details> 
<summary> High-Level </summary>  => More abstraction, it seems counterintuitive to say but high-level means the syntax is more natural and there is less manipulating of the computer technology itself when coding. </details>
<details>
<summary> Object-oriented</summary>  => A class in action or an "instance" that can both hold and manipulate data. 
</details>
<details>
<summary> Multi-Paradigm </summary> => A paradigm is a general trend of doing something so if we break down this term to be more simple it means that javascript can be performed in different styles of syntax and flow. For example, the way javascript is coded in React is different than Vue.
</details>
<details>
<summary> Dynamic typing </summary> => Javascript doesn't require manually defining the value of a variable; it automatically defines it. 

<b>Example</b>
{% highlight javascript %}
let example = true;
console.log(typeof example);
example = "intoString"; ...redeclares variable and automatically changes type...
console.log(typeof example);
{% endhighlight %}


</details>
<details>
<summary> DOM (Document Object Manipulation) </summary> 
Websites written in html or xml can be accessed through this API to alter, edit, remove, etc... what is on the document by it's classes or ID's.
</details>
