# Welcome to my developer journey!
I've worked with languages such as Javascript, C++, C-sharp, and Swift. Javascript ES6 code ingenunity adds some many cool features to innovate and replicate code between files. C-sharp is a **clean**, compact language in my opinion while c++ although be one of the first languages still has many developers finding unprecedented ways to manipulate data.  I had a difficult time learning Swift because I had never used **X-Code** before plus the course I did was my very first introduction into **app design**
