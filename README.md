# smile-bold.github.io
My own personal progress journey as a code developer. 
# MEMO 
-- I want to forge a network of like-minded developers to discuss code, learn from each other, and create projects
that are innovative as well as structured. I'm learning the ropes of the Jekyll blog framework currently; so, it will be 
some time before my site is fully operational -- 
# My Brand
The brand I'm creating is :balloon:**bold_coding**:balloon: 
(lower-case seems more swaggerish)
# Issues 
-- I've come across several things that should be noted for anyone reading this and planning on making a Jekyll page. 
SASS is deprecated so anything using SASS is no longer supported for Jekyll. Jekyll runs on an old version of Kramdown; so, for right now
the dependability issue that's popping up; you can't do anything about it. --
